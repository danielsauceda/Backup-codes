* Backup-codes
Collection of Bash codes that automate the backup of data


+ For this collection of codes to work the following must be completed:
+ Installation of rclone https://rclone.org/install/
+ Configuration of rclone with Team Drive https://rclone.org/drive/


** Linux usage

*** Installation/Configuration
+ The backup codes are contained within src/backup.sh simply move this file to a desired location.
+ Edit the following variables in src/backup.sh
#+begin_src bash :eval no
# your directory in the google drive
GOOGLE_DIRNAME="Daniel Sauceda"

# Name of the team drive done when configuring rclone team drive
RCLONE_REMOTE_NAME="Arroyave_team_drive"
#+end_src

*** Functions
There are three functions that should be adequate to backup your files
#+begin_src bash :eval no
# sync a directory to the Team google Drive
rclone_sync_backup
# Tar a directory and upload to dated backup directory in the Team Google Drive
tar_directory_backup

# Tar subdirectories within a root directory and upload the root directory to a dated backup directory in the Team Google Drive
tar_subdirectories_backup
#+end_src

*** intended Usage
The idea is you can copy paste the different function names at the bottom of the script like so:
#+begin_src bash :eval no
### YOUR CODE HERE
rclone_sync_backup -d ~/AA_BB --exclude '*analysis_AA_BB/**'
tar_directory_backup -d ~/new_elastic_structures --exclude 'AA_BB_CC_DD
#+end_src
However in the case of different directories you may wish to backup different directories at differnt time intervals.
Therefore, simply copy backup.sh to backup1.sh, backup1.sh etc such that:

backup1.sh
#+begin_src bash :eval no
### YOUR CODE HERE
rclone_sync_backup -d ~/AA_BB --exclude '*analysis_AA_BB/**'
#+end_src

backup2.sh
#+begin_src bash :eval no
### YOUR CODE HERE
tar_directory_backup -d ~/new_elastic_structures --exclude 'AA_BB_CC_DD
#+end_src

*** Crontab integration
using ~contab -e~ we can specify the intervals at which each backup will execute http://crontab.org/

Example:
#+begin_src bash :eval no
# run at 2:15pm on the first of every month
15 14 1 * *     cd /path/to/src/directory/ && sh backup1.sh

# run at 5 after 4 every sunday"
5 4 * * sun cd /path/to/src/directory/ && sh backup2.sh
#+end_src
